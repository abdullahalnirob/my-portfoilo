                <p className="text-white py-5">Hi! Iâ€™m Abdullah, a dedicated MERN stack developer with a passion for
                    building fast, scalable, and user-friendly web applications. I
                    specialize in full-stack development using MongoDB, Express.js, React,
                    and Node.js  from crafting powerful REST APIs to developing
                    responsive frontends. With a strong understanding of both backend
                    logic and frontend design, I enjoy creating seamless user experiences
                    that are not only functional but also visually appealing. I'm
                    comfortable working across the entire stack, integrating third-party
                    APIs, handling authentication, deploying apps, and optimizing
                    performance.
